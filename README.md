# Heriwr

> The wind whips crimson blades of grass, howling its mournful song. A bruised sky bleeds over the mountains, transforming emerald giants into obsidian sentinels against a tempestuous sea. The ocean churns, not with familiar blue, but a deep, angry red, as if the storm itself stains the water. The air crackles, a strange energy both terrifying and exhilarating. A salty gale whispers of challenge. This is a world of fury, a landscape where danger and adventure wage a ceaseless battle.

<i>Heriwr</i> is table-top roleplaying game based on the LIFEGUARD system, which is itself derived from MARK OF THE ODD games, including CAIRN, MYTHIC BASTIONLAND, RUNECAIRN, MAUSRITTER and more.

The game uses only six-sided dice, and characters have just two attributes - LIFE, and GUARD. Heriwr is a roll-under system with a built in death spiral, designed for play in the world of MYNYDDMOR, a world inspired by Wales, the Welsh people and the mythology of the MABINOGION.
