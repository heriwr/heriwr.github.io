# Basic Rules

## Abilities
Each of the six abilities is used in different circumstances.

- __Strength__: Used for melee attacks and saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, etc.
- __Dexterity__: Used for ranged attacks and saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes, like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
- __Constitution__: Used for saves to resist poison, sickness, cold, etc. The Constitution bonus is added to healing rolls. A PC's number of item slots is always equal to their Constitution defence.
- __Intellect__: Used for saves requiring concentration and precision, such as recalling information, crafting objects, tinkering with machinery, identifying Exotica, etc.
- __Psyche__: Used for saves requiring perception and intuition, such as tracking, navigating, searching for secret doors, communing with psychic powers, etc. The Psyche bonus is added to the damage dealt by Mystic Gifts. 
- __Ego__: Used for saves requiring willpower and charm, such as persuading, deceiving, intimidating, resisting mental domination, etc.

## Saving Throws
If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences, they make a saving throw, or "save". To make a save, add the bonus of the relevant ability to a d20 roll. If the total __exceeds 15__, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.  

If the save is opposed by another character, then instead of aiming to exceed 15, the side doing the rolling must get a total greater than the opposing character's relevant defence score in order to succeed. If they fail, the opposing side succeeds. This type of save is called an opposed save. Note that it doesn't matter which side does the rolling, since the odds of success remain the same.  

If there are situational factors that make a save significantly easier or harder, the referee may grant the roll __advantage__ or __disadvantage__. If a roll has advantage, roll 2d20 and use the better of the two dice. If it has disadvantage, roll 2d20 and use the worse of the two dice.

## Item Slots
PCs have a number of item slots **equal to their Constitution defence.** Most items, including light weapons, tools and so on take up 1 slot, but particularly heavy or bulky items like armour or medium to heavy weapons will take up more slots. Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into the same slot, at the referee's discretion. Carrying more items than your slot limit will make your character __Encumbered__, which imposes disadvantage on all physical saves. It is impossible to carry more than 20 slots worth of items.

## Combat
Initiative in combat is decided each turn. All sides of a conflict roll d6, and whichever side rolls higher acts first. Resolve ties in favor of the players.

On their turn, a character may move and take up to one combat action. This action may be using a Gift, making a second move, making an attack, attempting a stunt, or any other action deemed reasonable by the referee.  

Melee weapons can strike adjacent foes, but ranged weapons cannot be used if the shooting character is engaged in melee combat. To make an attack, roll a d20 and add the character's Strength or Dexterity bonus, depending on whether they are using a melee or ranged weapon, respectively. If the attack total is __greater than__ the defender's armor defence value, the attack hits. If not, the attack misses.  

Alternatively, an attack roll can also be resolved by the defender rolling a d20 and adding their armor bonus, hoping to roll a total __greater than__ the defence of the ability the attacker is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits.  

On a hit, the attacker rolls their weapon's damage die to determine how many __Hit Points__ (__HP__) the defender loses. A bonus damage die of the weapon's type may be added to the roll if the ideal weapon was used against an enemy type.

## Wounds and Healing
When a character takes damage and their HP drops below 0, they receive a corresponding **Wound** from the chart below. Their HP remains at a negative value until they are healed, with all subsequent damage incurring more severe Wounds. Wounds occupy item slots. If 10 item slots fill with Wounds, the character dies. A character also dies if any ability defense drops to 0. When a character is healed, their HP recovers as though starting from 0.

|1|Just a scratch| - |You were lucky, this time.|
|2|Damaged Item| - |A random inventory item is destroyed or damaged.|

HP is replenished via Short and Long Rests.  

**Short Rest:** quick sit-down, with a ration of water or meal. Replenishes d8 + CON bonus HP.

**Long Rest:** full night’s sleep, with both a ration of water and a meal. This either replenishes all HP or heals one Wound. Ability defenses that have been depleted by enemy attacks replenish at the rate of one point per day.  

If your character is __Deprived__ they cannot benefit from Short or Long Rests. Deprivation can be incurred through many means, but the most common are starvation or thirst.

## Water
Vaarn has a fluid economy; potable water is one of the most valuable resources in the blue wastelands. Up to three rations of water can be carried in one item slot. 
Biological PCs must drink one ration of water every day. Synthetic PCs must imbibe a ration of water weekly, in order to cool their general syntax boards and ego-engines. Failure to do so will result in the character becoming Deprived. If a character is Deprived due to thirst for three days in a row, they will perish.

## Barter
Merchants will usually trade an item slots’ worth of goods for similar, putting a premium on rations of water and items of Exotica. There is no set list of prices for goods in Vaarn. The deals characters can strike will depend upon context, the merchant’s disposition, and how persuasive they are. 

## Mystic Gifts
Vaarn is a world where religion, science, and magic are indistinguishable. Devout faith, mastery of arcane nano-machines, abuse of psychoactive fungus, or mental mutation can grant the mind uncanny influence over the material world. All such powers, abilities, and boons are referred to as **Gifts**.
- Each Mystic Gift uses **one item slot**; this represents the burden these unnatural powers exert on the body of the wielder.
- Using a Gift costs HP, determined by the Referee once the player describes what they want to accomplish. The baseline cost for using a Gift is **d6 HP.**
- Combat Gifts always hit their target, dealing damage of one dice size higher than the user paid in HP, plus the character’s PSY bonus. (Example: paying d6 HP results in a damage roll of d8 + PSY bonus).
- The same ratio applies when healing an ally using a Gift. Gifts like mind control or force barriers can be used for extended durations. In such cases the character must pay d6 HP for each ten-minute period that the Gift is active.

Mystic Gifts are not earned by gaining Levels; they must be hunted for. Sources of new Gifts include consuming psychoactive drugs, brain surgery, training with another psychic, eating another psychic’s brain, or meditating in front of a hypergeometric obelisk. The Referee can decide. 

### Psyche Slots
Psyche slots are an alternative method of tracking Gifts. A PC has psyche slots **equal to their PSY bonus.** Each Gift occupies one psyche slot. If using this method, do not add the PC's PSY bonus to damage or healing caused by their Gifts.

## Exotica
Exotica are the strange relics of the many extinct civilizations that preceded your own. Exotica may take the form of weaponry, clothing, tools, or bizarre constructions that are beyond the understanding of mortal minds.

When a new item of Exotica is found, the Referee may ask for an INT save in order to puzzle out what the device does. If the save is failed, it is assumed that the PCs cannot understand the device. They can either have the item appraised at a settlement or use it and hope for the best. 

## Advancement
As PCs adventure in Vaarn, they will grow from novices into seasoned explorers. All new characters start at Level 1. A PC’s maximum Level is 10. When a PC's Level increases:
- They get three points to allocate to any Abilities of their choosing. Abilities may never be raised higher than 20 /+10.
- They roll a d8 and add the result to the maximum HP.

There are different triggers for Advancement which the Referee may consider using. It is reccomended that a group settles on one of these options before the campaign begins.

### Exotica for XP
PCs advance by trading in Exotica at settlements or oases. Trading in an item of Exotica grants 1 XP to the PC who traded it in. When a PC's XP tally equals their current Level, they advance by one Level and erase their current XP tally.

### Exotica for Levels
PCs advance by trading in Exotica at settlements or oases. Trading in an item of Exotica will automatically raise a PC to their next Level. A single Exotica can only be used to raise the Level of one PC, not the entire party. This will create important decisions for the party, as most likely only one PC will be able to level up at a time. If the Referee wants an even faster campaign, have all PCs level up for each one Exotica traded, excluding that of the starting equipment.

### Expeditions for XP
PCs advance by completing Expeditions. The precise nature of a single Expedition will be defined by the Referee, but they usually involve extended journeys during which the characters solve problems, negotiate with or battle opponents, and discover more about the world of Vaarn. Completing an Expedition will gain you one experience point or XP. When your XP equals your current Level, increase your Level by one and erase all XP tallies.
