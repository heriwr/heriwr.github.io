Dice Rolling:

Use Saves Sparingly: Only call for saving throws when the outcome is uncertain, the stakes are high, and there are consequences for failure.
Storytelling:

Embrace Improvisation: 

Don't pre-plan every detail of the story. Instead, create interesting situations and problems for your players to solve, subvert, or avoid.

Player Agency: 

The core of the game is players making informed choices and the GM reporting the resulting consequences.

Transparency: 

Don't withhold information from your players without a good reason. You are their eyes and ears in the world of Heriwr, so describe the situation accurately and fully.
Emergent Storytelling: Let the narrative unfold organically based on the players' choices and the world's reaction.

Challenge and Surprise:

Open-Ended Problems: Don't create problems with a single, predetermined "correct" solution. Allow your players to be creative and surprise you with their solutions.

Dynamic Environments: Build interactive situations with dynamic threats and opportunities for player interaction.

Embrace the Dice: Use the random tables provided in the game to introduce unexpected events, locations, and NPCs into the world, keeping both you and your players on your toes.
Non-Player Characters (NPCs):

Vivid Personalities: Create NPCs with distinct personalities and clear motivations, even if they initially hide their true intentions.
Living World: NPCs are not just quest givers – they have their own lives, goals, and struggles. If the players revisit a location, something within it should have changed.
World of Heriwr:

Danger and Excitement: Make Heriwr feel dangerous. Combat is potentially deadly and not always fair. Remember, monsters and NPCs want to survive too – utilize reaction rolls, morale checks, and negotiation opportunities to create diverse and unpredictable conflicts.
Strange Beauty: Describe the world's unique features vividly, such as the red sun casting unusual shadows, the bizarre chrome-augmented creatures, and the spectacular light shows from falling orbital debris.
Exotica:

Powerful and Problematic: Exotica are valuable tools, but ensure they come with downsides to avoid them becoming the solution to every problem. Heriwr becomes less interesting if a single tool dominates gameplay.
House Rules:

Quick Decisions: The rules won't cover every situation. When needed, make fair and logical rulings to keep the game moving. If the situation recurs, discuss it with your players and collaboratively establish a permanent house rule.
