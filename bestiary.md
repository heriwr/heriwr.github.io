Anyone implanted with an Argent Halo cannot commit any acts of violence, nor are they able to remove the Halo without expert surgical help. Attempting to harm any living being while wearing a Halo will result in the wearer passing out, with no save possible.

The Shepherd preaches in clear, ringing tones the futility of opposing the laws of THEMIS. It will reason with those it meets, attempting to convince them of the moral logic of accepting a Halo. </td></tr>

They take the shape of enormous six-fingered hands, which grasp intruders and evict them using teleportation loci embedded in their palms.
<br />
<b>Non-lethal:</b> Banishers are forbidden from killing sentient life. They will first ask you to leave the vault, and lecture you about trespassing.

<b>Banish:</b> the Banisher grabs an intruder and teleports them to a designated eviction zone. Traditionally this is the entrance to the vault, although sometimes more punitive locations are chosen.
<br />
<b>Summon:</b> truly vexed Banishers, when faced with repeat offenders, may teleport in other creatures from the vault to deal with you permanently. Roll on the encounter table for this floor. The summoned creature is not loyal to the Banisher.

<br />
The creatures seek out radioactive blightstone and gain sustenance from basking near it, although they supplement this nourishment with a more conventional diet of raw meat. Blightbeasts are immune to damage caused by energy weapons or radiation, and heal d8 HP per round when in the presence of radioactive material. Blightbeasts have no natural predators, their flesh and blood being thoroughly poisonous. Their corpses cannot be used as a source of rations.</td></tr>

<b>The Brood:</b> a Brood Mother births d6 Broodlings [<b>Level</b> 0 (1 hp), <b>Armour</b> 12, <b>Bite</b> (d4)] per combat round, and 2d6 Broodlings on death. Fire or explosive attacks prevent this.

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: A dread creature from beyond the stars, brought to Urth in the hold of an Aurum Barge. The Chernobog is a colossal, black-furred beast, described as 'a child of mongoose and serpent, two foes united under one foul banner'. The creature is an apex predator on the benighted sphere it hails from, hunting by ambush in dark and forgotten places. It prefers caves and the labyrinthine basements of ruined structures as lairs, rarely venturing above ground.
<br> 
If this were not terrible enough, the beast emits a noxious gas from facial glands when enraged, choking and blinding its victims. The Chernobog uses these black clouds to corral prey or cover its escape.
<br>
<b>Black Cloud:</b> each round the Chernobog emits a cocktail of corrosive and hazardous fumes, dealing 2 damage to every character in the room. The cloud's strength doubles with each subsequent combat round. After three rounds all PCs are fighting as if blinded.

<b>Cave Fighter:</b> the Chernobog strikes with Advantage in enclosed spaces or against blinded creatures.</td></tr>

Roughly the size of a goat, they feed on blood which their razor-tipped trunks drain from sleeping animals and the folk of Vaarn alike. Daggertrunks are highly intelligent, surprisingly stealthy, and very cowardly. They will approach sleeping PCs at night and attempt to siphon blood from their ankles or necks.</td></tr>

<b>Desiccate:</b> a biological target loses the water in their body. After one hit, they are Deprived due to thirst. After two hits, they lose d6 CON as the water in their organs is extracted.

<b>Regeneration:</b> The Fleshwarp regains 4hp per combat round, unless burned or dipped in acid.

<b>Grafting:</b>If the Fleshwarp has a biological target to attack, it will pounce. If the victim fails an opposed STR save, the Fleshwarp attaches one of its limbs to the victim’s torso. The Fleshwarp’s #Limbs and corresponding Level are lowered by 1.

The Fractalisk resembles a lizard from some angles, a blossoming flower from others, and at times can seem no more substantial than a fan of light reflected upon a wall. In all aspects, however, the creature is virulently dangerous.
<br />
<b>Recursive Gaze:</b> Any PC fixed with the Recursive Gaze must repeat the action they took the turn before, with no save allowed. This effect is broken if the Fractalisk’s gaze is interrupted, or if the creature dies.

<b>Self Similar:</b> Wounding a Fractalisk without the use of hypergeometric weaponry or anti-paradoxical normality gas causes the creature to spit into two identical Fractalisks, which can both target separate PCs with their Recursive Gazes.</td></tr>
