# Cybernetics
PCs may begin with a cybernetic implant instead of a mystic Gift at the GM’s discretion. Cybernetic implants do not take up item slots; however, each cybernetic implant is associated with one of a PC’s six Abilities. Each Ability may have only one implant assigned to it. Cybernetics cannot boost a PC’s stats past the natural 20/+10 maximum.
