# Dungeons

## The Basics

The Dungeon exploration cycle (see below) is divided into a series of Turns, Actions, and their consequences.

On each Turn, a character can move a distance equal to their torchlight's perimeter (about four squares) and perform one Action. Players can use their Action to move up to three times that distance, but doing so increases the chance of encountering a danger (wandering monster, sprung trap, etc.) which may also trigger a roll on the Dungeon Events table.

The Bard should freely present obvious information about an area and its dangers. Moving quickly or without caution may increase the chance of encountering a danger or triggering a roll on the Dungeon Events table.

While "Dungeon" is used here as an example, this structure can be adapted to any dangerous location, such as a mansion, farmhouse, or any other adventure site.

## Dungeon Exploration Cycle

1. Set the Scene:

The Bard vividly describes the party's current surroundings, highlighting any immediate dangers like potential combat, hidden traps, or unexpected surprises.

Based on this information, players declare their chosen character movements and intended Actions.

2. Resolve Actions

The Bard simultaneously resolves the actions of each character, including any ongoing effects from previous turns.

3. Consequences:

- Players diligently record any resource losses or acquired conditions arising from their actions (e.g., item usage, fatigue, etc.).
*The cycle then loops back to step 1. Additionally, the Bard may choose to roll on the Dungeon Events table for further narrative twists, always interpreting the results with common sense and a focus on enhancing the story.

## Dungeon Events

Exploring a Dungeon is always dangerous, and time must always be weighed against the risk of awakening the locationâ€™s denizens, natural hazards, and worse.

**Whenever the party...**

Spends more than one Dungeon cycle in a single room or location.
Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room.
Moves into a new area, level, or zone.
Creates a loud disturbance.

**... roll on the Dungeon Events table.**

### Dungeon Events Table

1. Encounter: Roll on an encounter table. (Possibly hostile.)
2. Environment: Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, ceilings collapse, a ritual nears completion, etc.
3. Loss: Torches are blown out, an ongoing spell fizzles, etc. The party must resolve the effect before moving on.
4. Exhaustion: The party must take a brief rest (roll on this table again), add Fatigue, or consume a ration.
5. Sign: A clue: spoor, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, droppings, etc., is discovered.
6. Quiet: The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being.

## Actions

These are any non-passive activities, such as searching for traps, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming a trap, engaging an enemy in combat, casting a spell, dodging a trap, running away, resting, etc.

Special Rules and Duration: Some actions have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple turns to complete.

Encountering Denizens: Loud or noticeable actions may also trigger an encounter with the Dungeon's inhabitants.

### Searching

#### Exhaustive Search

A character can spend a turn performing an exhaustive search of one object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc.
Thoroughness and Time

Larger rooms and difficult or complex Dungeon terrain may take a few turns to properly search.
Safety vs. Time

Searching a room first is a safer way to explore the Dungeon, but it takes time.
Resting

## Dungeon Elements

### Light

Torches and other radial light sources illuminate an area up to 4sq, beyond which only a dim outline of objects is visible. Torches last until extinguished by a character or the environment.

A torch can be lit three times before becoming permanently unusable. A lantern can be relit indefinitely, but requires an oil can (6 uses).

Characters without a light source may experience panic until their situation is remedied.

### Doors

Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, moving, or completely blocked. Characters can attempt to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue), or through raw physical ability.

The character most at risk should make a saving throw to avoid any danger that may befall them.

Through careful observation (listening, smelling, etc.), a character can detect signs of life and other hazards through nearby doors and walls.

### Traps

A cautious character should be presented with any relevant information that would allow them the opportunity to avoid springing a trap. An unwitting character will trigger the trap according to the narrative, or otherwise must pass a Guard Save.

Traps can usually be detected by carefully searching a room.

Damage from traps is taken from Life, but not Guard. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g., a breastplate would not reduce damage from noxious gas).
