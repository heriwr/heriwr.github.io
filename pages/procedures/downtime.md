# Downtime

Between game sessions, players can engage in a variety of activities such as research, following up on leads, improving skills, or building relationships. A PC is limited to one Downtime Action at a time. These actions cannot be undertaken in
unsafe conditions or while a character is in recovery. A character cannot perform an action if it would put their safety at risk.

## Tracking Progress

For activities requiring multiple steps, the Bard assigns 1-5 Milestones to track player progress. Each Milestone represents a standalone, non-interactive task. The Bard may offer different strategies to achieve these goals, each with unique Milestones. Additionally, the Bard has the flexibility to introduce new Milestones or discard existing ones based on the unfolding events in the game.

## Costs

PCs can complete individual Milestones by taking a Downtime Action and paying its associated Cost. If a character lacks the required Cost, they must find alternative ways to achieve their goal. Here are some examples of Cost types:

**Modwry: **The character's current income moves down a step (i.e. chest to sack).

**Resources:** Non-monetary costs like material goods, common items, etc.

**Reputation: **Leverages the character's renown, personality, social connections, etc.

**Loss:** Sacrifice of something precious and unique, like a finger, a soul, a Relic, etc.
Characters can potentially reduce or eliminate Costs through their skills, connections, or sheer willpower. For instance, a PC who already earned sufficient renown might gain access to a prestigious institution without paying the usual price. However, another character lacking such connections might need to rely on their force of personality to negotiate access. In such cases, the Bard should explain the potential risks (e.g., permanent ban, reputational damage). The PC then makes a WIL saving throw; success reduces or eliminates the Cost entirely.

## Downtime Actions

The following activities represent some of the most common Downtime Actions
a players can choose. The Bard can also create custom actions based on the
needs of play.

### Research

Milestones and Costs: Provided by the Bard once a question and source are identified.
Questions: Must stem from play experiences (examples included).
Sources: Can be people, places, factions, entities (NPCs, spirits, other PCs).
Examples provided with associated risks and considerations.

### Training

Character progress: Improve skills, abilities, or knowledge with narrative and mechanical results.
