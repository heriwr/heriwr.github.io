# Domains

## Strongholds

### Land Acquisition

Land can be gained through theft, grants, conquest, claims, or purchases.
Local royalty can legitimize your ownership if the land isn't already claimed or granted.
Your reputation impacts how you're received.

### Income and Lifestyle

Your land generates enough income to cover upkeep and a noble lifestyle for you and your lieutenants, unless specified otherwise by the referee.
Domain Events

Random events affect your land. Each downtime week, the referee rolls 2d6 on the domain events table.
Most are self-explanatory. A "powerful monster or person" could be a local wizard, dragon, etc. A "sub-faction" is a smaller group vying for power.

### Domain Actions

These are special downtime actions requiring a stronghold and an assigned lieutenant.
Each action has a "clock," and the assigned lieutenant is unavailable for other actions while it progresses.
Discuss implications with the referee, who determines cost and outcome based on your goals and diplomatic relations.
Progress the clock by one point each real-time week. Roll a fortune check every fourth tick; on a failure, progress stalls and the referee chooses a setback. You can withdraw but gain no benefit.

### Building a Stronghold

This is the first required domain action and requires claiming the land, construction gold, and workers.
Roll a fortune check for success, with the number needed based on size. Each attempt costs 12,000 GP.
Your stronghold can hold specific holdings based on size, granting unique resources (at the referee's discretion).
Refurbishing an existing stronghold costs one-third the time and gold of building new.
Upon completion, appoint a Castellan to manage daily needs. You can promote hirelings or followers.

### Lieutenants

Appoint additional lieutenants for special resources or domain actions, increasing debt (at the referee's discretion).
A secretary allows patronage, decrees, and laws.
A chancellor allows holding construction, speculation, and investment.
An ambassador opens trade routes and appeases creditors.
A spymaster gathers intelligence, performs espionage, and spreads propaganda.
A marshall raises battalions for war and seizes holdings for unique assets.

### Domain Economics

Your domain earns credit each season for trade routes and holdings.
Debt increases from certain actions. Track credit and debt on your character sheet.
Balance the books at season's end. If negative, you're in debt; positive earns credit for next season.
In debt, choose to speculate or keep the credit.

### Battalion Debt Ticks

Rabble: 1 tick, 2 GP
Regulars: 2 ticks, 4 GP
Elite: 4 ticks, 8 GP
Engine: 6 ticks, 12 GP
Strike Force: 8 ticks, 16 GP
If in debt, appease creditors, speculate, or face consequences (details under lieutenants).

### Favour

Your domain has diplomatic standing with others â€“ they either owe or don't owe you favour.
Spend all your favour with a domain for a free action; you must earn it again afterwards.

### Holdings & Unique Assets

Holdings are locations or factions with a unique asset, which can be traded or used (e.g., airshipyard, magic portal, griffon knights).
Use them in war, negotiations, trade, or as appropriate.

### War

Battles are primarily waged through battalions.
Order battalions through your general, who reports back when orders are resolved.
Orders typically follow "Send Eagle and Falcon Battalions to take Saint Garifods."
Battalions follow orders as best they can.

### Battalion Movement

Battalions move each real-time week.
Opposing sides ending a week in the same county battle.
Most battalions can't traverse difficult terrain. One move equals one county.
The referee tracks non-player battalion movement during downtime.
Battle:

Compare powers. If equal, the attacker is forced back. More power destroys weaker battalions.
A successful battle allows claiming the county as part of your domain after peace is made, along with access to holdings and potential trade routes.
The general reports battle results when resolved.

### Battalion Types

Several types of battalions exist: rabble, regulars, elites, strike forces, and engines.

Rabble: These untrained but armed individuals move once per week and possess 1 power, but no starting power until encountering another battalion. (Example: Union of furious farmers - 1 move, 1 untrained power)

Regulars: Typically trained and outfitted troops, regulars move once per week and wield 1 power. (Example: Red Street Regulars - 1 move, 1 power)

Elites: Boasting 2 power and 1 move per week, elite battalions include mounted knights and trained archers. (Example: Lord Cabaleros' Cavalry - 1 move, 2 power)

Strike Forces: Capable of traversing specific difficult terrain and performing special operations, strike forces have 2 move per week and 1 power. (Example: Griffon-riders of Montan Peak - 2 move, 1 power, flight over mountain or water)

Engines: While possessing the highest power (3), engines move only every other week. These include siege trains, olyphant riders, and flying fortresses.

### Strike Force Operations

To achieve victory reGuardless of opposing power, a strike force undertakes a specific action. Roll fortune, gaining advantage if it holds a specific advantage. A full success secures victory, while partial success eliminates losses reGuardless of outcome. Failure nullifies the strike force's impact and power contribution.

This presents a fantastic opportunity for a one-shot or PC involvement in battle, either physically or strategically, to alter the tide. Such a "special episode" can replace the standard fortune roll.

### Suing for Peace

Formal peace requires suing for it, even for the losing side. Appoint a lieutenant (Ambassador suffices) to make a fortune roll. A special "diplomat" lieutenant possessing specific knowledge of your foe can grant advantage, or you can offer appeasement gifts like a creditor. This is another chance for PC involvement, potentially replacing the fortune roll with a "special episode".

### Allegiance

If ruling a domain isn't your desire, offer allegiance to a lord (PC or NPC). Upon acceptance, you become their lieutenant (e.g., marshal or spymaster) and receive missions alongside other lieutenants during gameplay sessions, potentially with a separate party.
