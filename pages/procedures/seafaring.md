# Sailing

## Battle

Each ship needs a token with a front and back. If two or more ships battle, place a six-sided die between them on the table to represent their distance. This distance is relative to all ships, meaning your movement affects everyone in the battle. Remember, ship movement is an abstraction.

Each turn, all ships roll their speed die (slow: d6-, average: d6, fast: d6+). The highest roll moves up to the difference between their die and the second highest; the second highest moves up to the difference between theirs and the third highest, and so on. For each move, you can close the distance, increase the distance, or tack 90 degrees to aim your cannons.

Boarding distance is 1. Escape distance is 6, allowing ships to leave without pursuit.

Moving away with your back facing an enemy lets you use charges or mines to slow them or damage their ship. When facing an enemy within range, use your sternchaser to damage their ship or crew. If tacked relative to a ship, use cannons. To attack, the attacker, not "marshal," rolls.

Ships facing their attacker have disadvantage and are easier to hit. Roll with advantage when attacking them.

Ship weapons are like regular weapons but deal siege damage (1 point = 10 standard damage). They only affect other ships, have 1-5 range, and their position determines their effect. The ship description shows how many guns you have.

Fore attacks target crew (reduced to 0 Life if hit). Roll a d20, hitting the numbered crew member.

Rams (d6+, siege, range 1, charge, fore), Harpoons (d6-, siege, range 1, grapple), Mines/Greek Fire (d6+, siege, range 2, aft), Charges (reduce speed by 1, range 2, aft), Short Guns (d6, siege, range 3), Cannons/Ballistae (d6+, siege, range 4), Long Guns/Catapults (d6-, siege, range 5). Rams require charging (moving 1 before attacking). Harpoons grapple ships until removed.

## Ships

Name, Description, Life (weight x 5), Guard, Boarding Capacity (weight), Travel Speed (slow, normal, fast), Attack Speed (d6-, d6, d6+), Fore Guns (#), Aft Guns (#), Side Guns (#), Cargo (#)
Speed determines weight: Fast (lightest, 1 weight for d6+, 2 for d6, 3 for d6-), Normal (moderate, 4 for d6+, 5 for d6, 6 for d6-), Slow (heaviest, 7 for d6+, 8 for d6, 9 for d6-).
Weight limits guns and cargo: A slow d6- ship can carry up to 6 guns (fore, aft, 2 sides) or cargo (fore, aft, 1 side gun, 2 cargo). You can mount half-guns on one side for half damage.
Ships can expend cargo for special abilities.

## Travel

Rations feed one crew member for 2 weeks (1 cargo holds 10 inventory slots).
Travel speeds: Slow = half speed, Normal = normal speed, Fast = double speed. Unpowered ships drift slowly towards the nearest planet (a specific location or random event).
Most sailing actions take one day (24 hours, in-game time). Each day follows this cycle:
Spend power or drift. The referee rolls the exploration die.
Spend a ration or lose 1d6 HP.
Roll the exploration die (d6, +1 per day with no result):
1-4: Nothing happens.
5-6: Sailing encounter.
7-8: Weather changes.
9: Spells expire.
10+: Shore leave required.
Repeat the cycle for each PC action, transitioning as needed.
