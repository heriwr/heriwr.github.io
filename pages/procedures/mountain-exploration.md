# Mountain Exploration

## Watches

A watch is eight hours. A day is divided into three Watches: morning, afternoon, and night. A halfwatch is four hours, and so on.

Each character can choose one Mountain Action (page x.x) per watch.

If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

## Points

Potential destination on a map are called points.

One or more watches may be required to journey between two points on a map, depending on the path, terrain, weather and party status.

The party should havea  rough idea of the challenges involved to get to their destination, but rarely any specifics.

## Travel Duration

Travel time in Heriwr is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third watch of the day resting, one can use "days" as shorthand for travel time. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four watches, the party would need to travel for two days, arriving in the evening of the second day.

To determine the distance between two points, combine all penalties from the path, terrain, and Weather Difficulty (pg. 77) tables, taking into account any changes to those elements along the route. For travel via waterways, refer to the
surrounding terrain difficulty. For especially vast terrain, assign a penalty of up to +2 watches to the journey.

The weather, terrain, darkness, injured party members, and other obstacles can impact travel or even make it impossible! In some cases, the party may need to add Fatigue or expend resources in order to sustain their pace. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party’s travel speed or even negate certain penalties.

|Perilous| Steep climbs, high altitude, narrow path, cliffside | +2 Watches| Unclean water, poisonous plants and animals, poor navigation|

## Weather

Each day, the Bard should roll on the weather table for the appropriate season. If the “Extreme” weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to “Catastrophic.” A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

|Unpleasant| Add +1 watch.| Gusting winds, rain showers, sweltering heat, chill air|
|Inclement |Add +1 watch or lose 1 Life. Increase terrain difficulty by a step.|Thunderstorms & lightning, rain, muddy ground|
|Extreme| Deprived after travel. Add +1 watch and lose 1 Life. Increase terrain difficulty by a step.| Blizzards, freezing winds, flooding, mud slides|
|Catastrophic| Most parties cannot travel under these conditions.|Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, volcanic eruption|

## Mountain Elements

### Night

The party can choose to travel at night and rest during the day, but be warned: night travel is significantly slower and more dangerous!
Due to increased hazards, the Bard should roll twice on the Mountain Events table when traveling at night.
Consider that some terrain and weather, like deserts, might be easier to navigate at night. The Bard should weigh these advantages against any additional challenges.

### Sleep

Typically, the last watch of the day is reserved for the Make Camp action (pg. x.x).
Characters generally need to sleep each day. Even minor interruptions can diminish or completely negate the benefits of sleep.
Skipping the Make Camp action leaves each party member with one Fatigue and the "deprived" condition. Additionally, traveling while sleep-deprived increases the terrain difficulty by one step (e.g., Easy becomes Tough).

### Light

Torches and other radial light sources illuminate a 40-foot cone ahead of the party, providing only dim outlines beyond that.
Characters without a light source might panic until they remedy the situation.
Environmental factors like wind, dust, or water can easily extinguish torches.
Light Sources:

A torch can be lit three times before degrading.
A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires a separate oil can (providing six uses).

### Mountain Exploration Cycle

1. The Bard describes the current point or region on the map and how the path, weather, terrain, or party status might affect travel speed. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination.
2. Each character chooses a single Mountain Action (pg. 80). The Bard narrates the results, and then rolls on the Mountain Events table. The party responds to the results.
3. The players and the Bard record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, deprivation, etc), and the cycle repeats.

## Mountain Actions

### Travel

Traveling reveals nearby areas gradually, with obvious features and terrain becoming visible based on distance. This action typically involves the entire party moving together.
A d6 roll determines if the party gets lost. The risk depends on Path Difficulty (pg. 76), maps, party skills, and guides.
If lost, the party might need to spend a Mountain Action to find their way again. Otherwise, they reach the intended destination. Remember to compare getting lost results to the corresponding Path Difficulty.

### Explore

One or more party members can search a large area for hidden features, scout ahead, or navigate cautiously.
This might lead to discovering a Location (shelter, village, cave, etc.) or Feature (geyser, underground river, beached ship, etc.).
Even after exploring the current area thoroughly, the Travel action is still required to move on.
Supply:

Characters can attempt to hunt, fish, or forage for food. The first party member taking this action gathers 1d4 Rations (each providing 3 uses).
Additional participants increase the chance of a bigger bounty (e.g., 1d4 becomes 1d6, up to a maximum of 1d12). Relevant experience or equipment can also improve the yield.
The party might encounter homes or small villages where they can spend gold and a full Watch (pg. 75) to restock supplies.

### Make Camp

Setting up camp involves stopping in the Mountain and consuming a Ration per party member (including mounts).
To ensure everyone can sleep safely, a lookout rotation is established. Ideally, three rotations are needed. Smaller parties might have to sleep unguarded or take turns sleeping over multiple days.
Party members who get a proper rest remove all Fatigue from their inventory.
