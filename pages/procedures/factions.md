# Factions

Factions are any organized groups with distinct goals and identities that function outside the boundaries of traditional political domains. They range from small, clandestine guilds to sprawling mercenary companies.  Factions play a pivotal role in shaping the game world, and their impact  extends to both player characters and existing domains. Factions fuel a dynamic world that responds organically to player actions and empower players who want to directly influence the world.

## Integrating Factions with Domains

The faction system weaves smoothly into your existing domain system. For maximum impact, time-strapped GMs should only feature actively relevant factions to avoid unnecessary complexity. It's worth remembering that not every organisation needs a corresponding faction â€“ Factions should be those who proactively seek to change the status quo.

## Faction Dynamics

Factions continuously interact with each other, domains, and player characters, often leading to conflict, alliances, or complex schemes.  They are sustained by three key resources:

**Holdings:** A Faction's income-generating assets, such as mines, farms, or controlled trade routes. These are measured in Wealth and are limited based on the Domain's productivity where the Holding is located.
**Wealth:** A measure of the faction's financial resources (1 Wealth = 10sp). Wealth allows factions to pay their members and pursue various actions.
**Influence:** Indicates a faction's reputation and sway with other factions, domains, and the populace. Influence ranges from 0 to 10 and is earned or lost through a faction's actions.
Faction Costs

Factions must pay their members (leaders and hired personnel) in Wealth at the start of each year. This is based on the individual member's HD/WD.  If a Faction lacks the funds, they must choose who is paid, potentially leading to disgruntled members leaving.

## The Faction Turn

The structure of a faction turn promotes regular actions and consequences:

**Pay Members:** Cover member costs using the faction's Wealth.
**Faction Actions:** Factions can take four actions per year to advance their goals (detailed below).
**Earn Income:** Factions generate wealth equal to the total value of their Holdings.
Faction Actions (Expanded)

**Contracted Work:** Work for other factions or domains for pay. The Faction can also perform Domain Actions if their capabilities justify it.
**Volunteer:** Same as Contracted Work, but with benefits to Influence instead of Wealth.
**Quest:** Engage in GM-designed quests for Influence or narrative benefits, with potential for failure and lost Influence.
**Become Domain:** A powerful enough Faction can attempt to seize control of a Domain lacking a ruler. This can involve social encounters, combat, or skill checks.
**Depose Leadership:** A Faction within a weak Domain (Stability 5 or lower) can try to overthrow its leadership (through gameplay or skill checks).
**Military Actions:** Wage campaigns, raids, or defend holdings (with modifications from the Domain system, detailed further in full rules document).
**Develop Holdings:** Spend Influence to acquire new holdings or Wealth to develop existing ones.
**Sway Holdings:** Attempt to take holdings from rival factions using Influence or skill checks.
**Inflict Problem:** Select a problem from a Faction-specific table to challenge another faction or domain.
**Deal With a Problem:** Resolve an existing problem through gameplay or skill checks.
**Recruit Members:** Increase membership for free (up to 5% per year) or spend Influence for a larger recruitment drive.
**Diplomatic Mission:** Persuade or negotiate with factions, domains, or individuals (requires roleplay or skill checks).
**Destroy Faction:** A powerful Faction can try to dismantle a weakened rival (Influence 0).

## Faction Problems

While factions don't roll for problems in the same way that domains do, they can still face challenges inflicted upon them by other factions or domains. When targeting a faction with a problem, the instigating party may choose from the following list:

**Ruined Reputation:** The faction's influence suffers due to a targeted campaign of rumors and damaging critiques. If not resolved by the end of the year, the faction loses 2 Influence.
**Damaged Holdings:** A faction's holdings within a province have been sabotaged or seized, rendering them ineffective. If not addressed by the end of the year, the faction gains no Wealth from those holdings for that year.
**Demoralized Members:** The faction's members are losing faith in their cause. This results in their total Determination Points being halved for the rest of the year.
**Heist:** Skilled thieves have been hired to steal a significant portion of the faction's supplies. Unless they are stopped, the faction loses one-fifth of its Wealth at the end of the year.
**Assassination:** Assassins target a prominent member of the faction. If not dealt with by the end of the year, this member will be killed, and the faction will lose 1 Influence.
**Godly Disfavor:** The faction has fallen out of favor with the gods. All faction-level skill checks now have a -2 penalty until the end of the year. Resolving this problem also prevents the faction from losing 1 Influence.
