# 11. Rotspeaker

> A writhing mass of decay dwells within your skull. This parasitic entity, a blight upon the natural order, cannot manifest in the material world without a vessel. To sustain this twisted symbiosis, the rot shares fragments of the ruinous power it has siphoned from countless withering hosts.

Name the rot and declare one Topic it knows about due to its prior host. The rot also possesses knowledge of magic. Randomly select one Spell and one Ritual, then choose one additional Spell and one additional Ritual that it remembers.

You may ask questions about the Topic your demon knows about, as per the Scrivener’s Deep Lore ability, due to inheriting its knowledge.

You may cast or perform any Spells or Rituals your rot knows as though it were a Grimoire. It can learn new Spells and Rituals the same way you would transfer them into a normal Grimoire. By stepping down any of your Attributes you can let your Demon to cast a Spell for you. Doing so no longer requires use of your hands, or paying the usual costs (setting your Grit to zero or making a WIL Save) and does not take up your action in combat.

Whenever you fail a Life Save, compare the result with Rot Table.

|2d6|Rot Result|

|2| When under stress, your voice shifts and distorts, with the rot's whispers leaking through.|
|3| Entities focused on decay and corruption (undead, malevolent nature spirits) become drawn to you, potentially leading to confrontations or unwanted pacts.|
|4| You become numb to the suffering of others. You might even take a perverse pleasure in acts of destruction.|
|5| You're plagued by intrusive thoughts urging you towards acts of decay – destroying objects, harming small creatures, or spreading blight.|
|6| A weeping, necrotic wound appears somewhere on your body. It won't heal naturally and might even spread.|
|7| Your presence causes plant life to wither, food to spoil prematurely, and small animals to become sickly.|
|8| A part of your body becomes warped and grotesque – a gnarled hand, a rotting eye, etc.|
|9| Fungal growths or mould colonies sprout from your skin, becoming more extensive with each failed save.|
|10| Others instinctively recoil from you, sensing the taint of decay within you. |
|11| Stories of your unsettling behavior begin to circulate, attracting suspicion or even outright fear.|
|12| A creeping belief in the futility of life takes root. With each failed save, roll on the Doom table.|
