# 11. Rotspeaker

> A writhing mass of decay dwells within your skull. This parasitic entity, a blight upon the natural order, cannot manifest in the material world without a vessel. To sustain this twisted symbiosis, the rot shares fragments of the ruinous power it has siphoned from countless withering hosts.

## Starting Equipment

* Blighted Staff

* A fragment of something once beautiful or meaningful, now partially decayed from your life before the rot took hold.

* Pouch of Spores and Seeds

* Animal skull mask.

## Core Ability

Name the rot and declare one Topic it knows about due to its prior host. The rot also possesses knowledge of magic. Randomly select one Spell and one Ritual, then choose one additional Spell and one additional Ritual that it remembers.

You may ask questions about the Topic your rot knows about, as per the Scrivener’s Deep Lore ability, due to inheriting its knowledge.

You may cast or perform any Spells or Rituals your rot knows as though it were a Grimoire. It can learn new Spells and Rituals the same way you would transfer them into a normal Grimoire.

## Advanced Abilities

Whenever you advance in Notoriety, choose one:

**Rot Sense:** Pick taste, smell, or touch. You are unnaturally sensitive to the presence of decay.  This manifests in heightened perception of the chosen sense. You might experience putrid smells, acrid flavors, or the sensation of crawling rot,  intensifying as you near centres of corruption, blight, or even undead creatures.

**Embrace the Decay:**  When you are knocked unconscious or your mind is impaired, you can relinquish control to the rot within. Your body becomes a conduit for entropic forces, lashing out in unpredictable ways until the effect fades or you regain clarity.

**Tap into the Blight:** Set your Guard to zero for ten minutes, or destroy a fragile, delicate, or complex object in your possession. In doing so, you channel a wave of rotting energy. This manifests as a 2d6 damage orb of decaying power, accelerating the decomposition of anything it touches.

## Rotting

Whenever you fail a Life Save, compare the result with Rot Table.

|2d6|Rot Result|
|-----|-----|
|3| Your voice shifts and distorts, with the rot's whispers leaking through.|
|4| Entities focused on decay and corruption (undead, malevolent nature spirits) become drawn to you.|
|5| You're plagued by intrusive thoughts urging you towards acts of decay – destroying objects, harming small creatures, or spreading blight. Set your Guard to 0 until you act upon your urges.|
|6| A weeping, necrotic wound appears somewhere on your body. It won't heal naturally and might even spread.|
|7| Nearby plant life withers, food spoils prematurely, and small animals become sickly. Reduce rations by 1.|
|8| A part of your body becomes warped and grotesque – a gnarled hand, a rotting eye, etc.|
|9| Fungal growths or mould colonies sprout from your skin.|
|10| Others instinctively recoil from you, sensing the taint of decay within you. |
|11| Stories of your unsettling behavior begin to circulate, attracting suspicion or even outright fear.|
|12| A creeping belief in the futility of life takes root. With each failed save, roll on the Doom table.|
