# Magic

## Types of Magic

Magic broadly comes in two categories: spells and rituals. Spells are immediate but usually less powerful, whereas rituals take time to perform but can have sweeping effects. 

Anyone can cast spells and perform rituals, they just need a Grimoire or Scroll to store them in.

Other types of magic exist, but have their own are unique mechanics and traditions.

## Grimoires

Grimoires are bulky tomes which can store any number of spells and rituals.  Spells and rituals can be transferred into a Grimoire from another Grimoire or Scroll, but doing so takes an hour and removes the magic 
from the original source.

## Scrolls

Scrolls store only a single spell or ritual, and may be used only once a day.

## Conduit

Conduits may be equipped as a 1H, 2H or R Weapon. Wands (R), sceptres (1H) and staves (2H) can be imbued with a single spell through enchantment (see Enchantment, page x.x)

## Rituals (Pg 50)

Rituals are powerful and long lasting, but are time consuming and inconvenient to perform. 

PCs can pool their MD to increase the effectiveness of the spell. Only one PC needs to know the spell.

To perform a ritual, read it out of the Grimoire while performing any required actions and sacrificing any required components. 

Performing a ritual takes at least ten minutes, unless otherwise specified. 

## Spells

Spells are quick and easy to cast, but tend to have flashy and fleeting effects. Casting a spell costs 1 Life and requires Magic Dice (MD).

To cast a spell chant it aloud while using both hands to channel the magic and roll your Magic Dice. You must have your Grimoire or a Scroll on your person. If you have Guard, set it to zero.

## Spell Duration 

If a spell does not list a duration it lasts as long as you invest dice to maintain Concentration.

## Spell Save

When you cast a spell against a creature that is actively trying to avoid it, the creature must make a Guard Save to avoid the effect. 

## Learning New Magic

Most characters learn new spells and rituals by finding them in the world. Some Callings have unique methods to gain new magic.

## Copying Spells

You can copy spells from scrolls into your grimoire.

This requires:

* sack for gold inks.
* One Halfwatch (4 hours).
* The scroll, which will be destroyed in the process.

## Creating a Grimoire

Creating a grimoire is time consuming and expensive.

You will need:

* One scroll, which will be sacrificed in the process.
* 200‚óç for inks.
* A blank book.
* One Watch (8 hours) of undisturbed labour under a full moon.
* You will be Deprived after completing the ritual.
