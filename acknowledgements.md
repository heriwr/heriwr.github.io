The novels that have been the biggest influence are [_The Book of the New Sun_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun) by Gene Wolfe, [_Dune_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) by Frank Herbert, and [_Hyperion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)) by Dan Simmons. Vaarn’s aesthetic owes a lot to the artwork of [Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud), [Kilian Eng](https://www.instagram.com/kilianeng/?hl=en), and [Decadence Comics](https://www.decadencecomics.com/). I have also been inspired by the videogames [_Rain World_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/) and [_Caves of Qud_](https://www.cavesofqud.com/). // I would like to thank everyone who bought, commented on, or downloaded the previous issues of this zine; it meant the world to me. I would also like to thank my Sunday gaming group, who were the first to explore Vaarn. // Further content, such as play reports and lore, can be found at [vaultsofvaarn.com](https://vaultsofvaarn.com).
