# Elixirs
Elixirs are the province of the Vaarnish alchymist, a catch-all term for wondrous unguents, salves, tonics, and nectars. Infused with exotic molecules and enthusiastic nanomachinery, these single-use concoctions grant the drinker a variety of beneficial effects. They may be ingested by all PCs except those who are **Synthetic** or **Mineral** in nature.

## Components and Essences
Elixirs are brewed using a single **Component** and varying quantities of **Essence**.  

**Components** are body parts harvested from dead creatures. This could be an eye, claw, tongue, heart, liver, etc. Only one Component can be harvested from a creature, and the harvester must make an INT save vs **10 + the creature's Level.** Failure results in the Component being spoiled. Components take up one item slot and do not stack.  

**Essences** are generic ingredient types that can be extracted from the corpses of dead creatures. No INT save is required to render a creature down into a single dose of its Essence. Up to ten of the same Essence can stack in one item slot. The type of Essence extracted relates to the creature's type, as follows: 

- **Blood** - extracted from *Biological* creatures. 
- **Supercoolant** - extracted from *Synthetic* creatures. Also found inside pre-Collapse computers.
- **Mycelium** - extracted from *Fungal* creatures. Also found in non-sentient mold and fungi.
- **Psychespinal Fluid** - extracted from *Psychic* creatures.
- **Manifold Marrow** - extracted from *Hypergeometric* creatures. 
- **Living Dust** - extracted from *Mineral* creatures. Also carried by Lithling as a sacrament.
- **Paradox Bile** - extracted from *Outsider* creatures. 

**Note:** *If a creature has two or more types listed, the PCs may choose which essence type is extracted. The other potential dose is lost during the process.*

## Potency
Elixirs have a Potency Level between 1 to 5. Potency should be determined by the Referee, with most Elixirs falling in the 1-3 range.  

A Potency 1 Elixir will have a minor effect comparable to a mundane item, such as allowing the drinker to vomit up a rope or briefly see in the dark.  

A Potency 3 Elixir is comparable to an Exotica in effect but not in duration, such as allowing a PC to teleport once or rendering them invisible for an hour.  

A Potency 5 Elixir will have a permanent consequence for a PC, such as giving them a new body part or Mystic Gift, permanently increasing an ability score, or cloning them perfectly. Remember that the effect of the Elixir must be tied to the nature of the creature its main Component derives from. 

## Brewing an Elixir 
Brewing requires three elements: a heat source, a pan, and a receptacle for the finished Elixir. The brewing process takes several hours and cannot be truncated - interruptions will spoil the Elixir and render it useless. 
The ingredients of an Elixir are **one Component**, which must be directly related to the Elixir's intended effect, and a number of **Essences equal to its Potency.** The Essences used must be of **different types.**  

**Example:** *A Potency 3 Elixir can be brewed using one dose each of Blood, Supercoolant, and Mycelium, but not using three doses of Blood.*

## Antidotes
Antidotes to the venom of toxic creatures can be brewed using the creature's venom as a Component. The Potency of the antidote is decided by the strength of the toxin: a d6 TOX attack requires a Potency 1 antidote, a d8 TOX attack requires a Potency 2 antidote, and so on. Ingesting an antidote prior to battle renders that character immune to the Toxin Dice inflicted by that creature. 

## Sample Elixirs
While the intent of the system is to allow the PCs to be creative in what they brew up, and to incentivise them to seek out unusual monsters in order to steal their powers, here are a few examples of Elixirs that might be brewed.

### Babel Beer
**Potency:** 1  
**Component:** A tongue  
**Effect:** Allows drinker to temporarily speak the languages known by the tongue’s owner. However, they will do so in the slurring, incoherent manner of one intoxicated.

### Doppeldraught
**Potency:** 2  
**Component:** Pickled flesh of a [Doppelgeller](https://vaarn.github.io/#/bestiary?id=doppelgeller)  
**Effect:** Drinker vomits up a jelly-clone of themselves. It resembles them but is translucent and mute. It will follow instructions, but dissolves after an hour.

### Skulk Salve
**Potency:** 3  
**Component:** The synth-skin of a [Subtle Stalker](https://vaarn.github.io/#/bestiary?id=subtle-stalker)  
**Effect:** Apply to flesh to become invisible for the next hour.

### Geneshock Tonic
**Potency:** 4  
**Component:** A cacogen's heart  
**Effect:** Drinker gains a new, permanent [mutation](https://vaarn.github.io/#/ancestries?id=mutations), matching that of the heart’s owner.

### Immortality Injector
**Potency:** 5  
**Component:** The mercurial war-flesh of a [Quicksilver Exterminator](https://vaarn.github.io/#/bestiary?id=quicksilver-exterminator)  
**Effect:** A biological creature injected with this fizzing froth of nanomachinery cannot die. It can be damaged beyond recognition, but the life will not leave its frame. This effect lasts for one day.

# Toxin Dice
While adventuring in Vaarn, characters may be exposed to poison, venom, radiation, or other toxins. The Toxin dice (TD) system is a way to track the harmful, lingering effects of such exposures. 

## Basics
A Toxin dice represents the damage caused by toxic substances. A TD is incurred when a PC is hit by a toxic attack and fails a CON save. Toxic attacks are indicated by the notation TOX.  For example, an attack with the damage notation ‘d6 TOX’ requires the target to make a CON save vs a d6 TD. 

## The Dice Chain
Toxin dice use a dice chain, which runs as follows:  
***Cured*** **< d4 < d6 < d8 < d10 < d12 < d20**  
When a TD shows a 1-4, it depletes and moves one step down the dice chain. When PCs reach the Cured step, they no longer have a TD.

## Saving vs Toxins
The more potent the toxin, the more difficult it is to resist. An afflicted PC must make a CON save vs 10 + the listed TD size.  

**Example:** *A d6 TOX attack requires a CON save exceeding 16. A d10 TOX attack requires a CON save exceeding 20, and so on.*

## Toxin Damage
Each combat round, before taking their action, a PC with a Toxin dice must roll the TD and subtract the number shown from their HP. On a roll of 1-4, the TD depletes one step.  
If the PCs are not in combat, they should roll their TD every ten minutes.

| TD Size | Average Damage Dealt | CON Save Must Beat |
|---|---|---|
|d4|2.5| 14
|d6|7.75| 16
|d8|16.75| 18
|d10|30.5| 20
|d12|50| 22
|d20|102.5| 30

## Multiple Sources of Toxins
A PC only has one TD at a time. Failing a save against a new TOX attack only increases the PC’s TD size if their current TD is smaller than the size indicated by the new attack.  

**Example:** *Magen is afflicted by a d8 Toxin dice. She is hit by a d6 TOX attack, and fails her CON save. However, as her TD is d8, higher than d6 in the dice chain, it does not increase in size.*

## Curing Toxins
The exact method will differ depending on the source of the toxin, but it should generally be assumed that the locals of an area will know some method of curing the affliction. Pre-Collapse medgel pods and surgeon synths will be of use. PCs trained in alchemy may also be able to brew up antidotes.
The Referee should consider allowing the PCs to attempt amputation of an afflicted limb, when appropriate.

## Radiation and Diseases
The system can expand to include a separate Radiation dice and Disease dice. For these deeper, more insidious ailments, have the PCs roll the dice once per day, but allow it to deal damage directly to their ability defences. Radiation sickness may whittle away CON, while Diseases could decrease any attributes the Referee thinks fitting. 
Be aware that losing ability scores severely weakens a PC, and ensure there are remedies to such afflictions.
