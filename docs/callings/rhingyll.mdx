# Rhingyll

You are a bulwark against those who threaten the order of things.  Your voice carries the weight of justice, your hand the strength of the law.  The peace and safety of your community rest squarely upon your shoulders.

You've seen the darkness that lurks in the hearts of men - the greed, the cruelty, the petty squabbles that can tear a village apart. Your duty is to stand against that darkness, to uphold fairness and protect the innocent.

You might be a seasoned guardsman, trained in sword and shield, patrolling the town walls with a vigilant eye.  Or, perhaps you are a wise elder, known for your level head and ability to settle disputes with reasoned words.

Yours is not always a path of glory. Your days are filled with the mundane and the gritty â€“  calming drunken brawls, mediating land disputes, or tracking down stolen livestock.  Yet, every small act of order you maintain is a stone laid in the foundation of a just society.

You may not wear a shining crown, but the peace you preserve is more precious than any jewel.
