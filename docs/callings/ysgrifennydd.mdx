# Ysgrifennydd

You are a scribe, a keeper of knowledge and a weaver of words. Your tools are the quill and parchment, your domain the vast realm of written history and the whispered secrets of the present.

Your hand is swift and precise, tracing letters with meticulous care. You understand the power of the written wordâ€”its ability to preserve memories, shape laws, and even inspire revolutions. While others wield swords, your weapon is information.

You might toil within the dusty archives of a lord's castle, meticulously copying ancient texts and preserving vital records. Or perhaps you are a wandering scholar, seeking out forgotten lore and documenting the songs and stories of the common folk.

You are a witness to your time. Your eyes may fall upon treaties between nations, the desperate pleas of the downtrodden, or the poetic musings of a troubled soul. You sift through the mundane and find the extraordinary, ensuring that the voices of the past and present are not lost to the relentless march of time.

Though your name may fade from memory, the words you safeguard will continue to shape the world long after you're gone.
