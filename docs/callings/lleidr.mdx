# Lleidr

You are the one who walks in the shadows. The city is your playground, its crowded streets and darkened alleys your hunting grounds.  You move with the grace of a stray cat, your eyes missing no glint of gold or whisper of opportunity.

Your fingers are nimble, practiced in the art of disappearing objects. A loosened purse string, a pilfered trinket, a key vanished without a trace â€“ these are the marks of your trade.  You are a master of disguise, blending seamlessly into the throngs, a face easily forgotten in the bustling markets.

Some call you a thief, a parasite preying on the wealth of others. You see yourself as resourceful, clever, simply better at navigating the twisted game of survival.  Whether it's a nobleman's overstuffed purse or a guarded secret, the lleidr sees only challenge, and the thrill of beating the odds.

You dance on a thin line, always a step ahead of the grasping hands of the law.  The shadows will always be your greatest ally.
