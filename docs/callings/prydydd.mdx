# Prydydd

You are more than just a poet. You are a crafter of words, a weaver of memory, a keeper of ancient knowledge. Your voice holds power, not just to entertain, but to shape the very legacy of your people.

You spent years in the bardic schools, mastering the intricate rules of cynghanedd, the rhythmic harmonies that bind the common language. You studied the tales of heroes and battles long past, the genealogies of kings stretching back into the mists of time.

Your tools are not sword or shield, but the sharp quill and the smooth page. You might travel at the side of a mighty lord, recording their triumphs for generations to come. Or, you may dwell in a village, capturing the essence of everyday life, the joy of harvests, and the sorrow of loss.

You are a historian, an entertainer, and perhaps even an advisor. Your words can inspire courage, soothe troubled hearts, or sting the pride of the unworthy.  Choose your verses wisely, for they will echo long after you are gone.
