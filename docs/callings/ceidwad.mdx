# Ceidwad

You are a guardian of wild places. The rustle of leaves is your language, the shifting shadows your allies. Your home is not walls of stone, but the vast, untamed wilderness of Mynyddmor.

Your senses are honed like a wolf's. You can read the tracks of beast and man alike, decipher the whispers on the wind, and navigate by starlight alone.  The forests, mountains, and hidden valleys are your domain, and their secrets run as deep as your own blood.

You are a skilled hunter, providing for yourself and those who rely on you. Your bow is an extension of your arm, your traps as cunning as a fox. But you are also a protector â€“ of the creatures that share the land, and of the ancient balance that must be maintained.

Some may call you solitary, a wild one who shuns the comforts of hearth and home. But you know that your bond with nature is stronger than any roof.
