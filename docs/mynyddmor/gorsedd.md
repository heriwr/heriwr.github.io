# Gorsedd

Gorsedd is built on the ruins of Ferrum, an Ordinatii outpost intended to keep order and contain the Bryceni. Inspired by London and Roman architecture.

Gorsedd is an integrated coastal city-fortress built into and around Mynydd Cadarn. The mountain itself possesses a peak elevation roughly equivalent to that of Snowdon (1085 meters), with a substantial portion of its base submerged in a coastal inlet.  

Structural Components:

1.  Porth y Dyfnder: A wide, naturally formed sea cave penetrates the mountain's base, serving as the primary maritime port. Internal docking and unloading facilities have been excavated to accommodate deep-draft shipping. 

2.  Ascending Habitation & Commercial Zones: Dwellings and commercial areas are built into the mountain's exposed slopes in successive tiers. Terracing with extensive hanging gardens is widely utilized. Inter-level connectivity is provided by excavated stairways, stone bridges, and cable-lift systems.

3. White Tree Courtyard (Llys Pren Gwyn): Approximately halfway up the mountain, a significant leveled platform has been created.  This space contains a park-like enclosure with soil sufficient to support a large, mature specimen of an unidentified tree species.  The tree's foliage exhibits mild bioluminescence. 

4. Tower of Guard (Tŵr Gwylio): A free-standing, multi-story tower of white marble crowns the mountain's peak. The tower surpasses the geological summit in height. Interior spaces include meeting halls and an observatory equipped with an unidentified artifact known as a "seeing stone." This artifact reportedly grants its user enhanced long-distance vision.

Noteworthy Features:

*   The project exhibits intricate, cooperative construction likely undertaken by both human and dwarven engineers.
*   The city demonstrates adaptive integration with a challenging geological environment, including the utilization of subterranean water access.
*   The continued structural stability of both the mountainside excavations and the freestanding tower warrant further study to understand the engineering principles used.

Research Recommendations:

*   Analyze the composition of the building materials to identify potential novel techniques used for durability and reinforcement
*   Conduct an environmental impact study on the presence of the city within the marine ecosystem
*   Attempt to replicate the properties of the "seeing stone" for potential applications
