# Gorsedd

Gorsedd is built on the ruins of Ferrum, an Ordinatii outpost intended to keep order and contain the Bryceni. Inspired by London and Roman architecture.

Gorsedd is an integrated coastal city-fortress built into and around Mynydd Cadarn. The mountain itself possesses a peak elevation roughly equivalent to that of Snowdon (1085 meters), with a substantial portion of its base submerged in a coastal inlet.  

Structural Components:

1.  Porth y Dyfnder: A wide, naturally formed sea cave penetrates the mountain's base, serving as the primary maritime port. Internal docking and unloading facilities have been excavated to accommodate deep-draft shipping. 

2.  Ascending Habitation & Commercial Zones: Dwellings and commercial areas are built into the mountain's exposed slopes in successive tiers. Terracing with extensive hanging gardens is widely utilized. Inter-level connectivity is provided by excavated stairways, stone bridges, and cable-lift systems.

3. White Tree Courtyard (Llys Pren Gwyn): Approximately halfway up the mountain, a significant leveled platform has been created.  This space contains a park-like enclosure with soil sufficient to support a large, mature specimen of an unidentified tree species.  The tree's foliage exhibits mild bioluminescence. 

4. Tower of Guard (Tŵr Gwylio): A free-standing, multi-story tower of white marble crowns the mountain's peak. The tower surpasses the geological summit in height. Interior spaces include meeting halls and an observatory equipped with an unidentified artifact known as a "seeing stone." This artifact reportedly grants its user enhanced long-distance vision.

Noteworthy Features:

*   The project exhibits intricate, cooperative construction likely undertaken by both human and dwarven engineers.
*   The city demonstrates adaptive integration with a challenging geological environment, including the utilization of subterranean water access.
*   The continued structural stability of both the mountainside excavations and the freestanding tower warrant further study to understand the engineering principles used.

Research Recommendations:

*   Analyze the composition of the building materials to identify potential novel techniques used for durability and reinforcement
*   Conduct an environmental impact study on the presence of the city within the marine ecosystem
*   Attempt to replicate the properties of the "seeing stone" for potential applications 

Here's a breakdown of key areas to flesh out Gorsedd, along with some unique details for inspiration:

**Governance, Power, & Social Structure:**

*   **Mixed heritage:** The collaboration between humans and dwarves is core to Gorsedd's existence. How is this reflected in the city's ruling structure? Is there a council,  co-leadership, or does power rest solely with one race?  
*   **Class Division:** Is there a clear hierarchy within the city? Are there separate districts for humans and dwarves? How does this play into tensions or dynamics? Does wealth play a defining social role?
*   **Role of the Tower:** Does the Tower of Guard exert political power over the rest of Gorsedd, or is it more of a symbolic, military center?

**Economic Engine:**

*   **Beyond simple port life:**  What else drives the economy? Does the mountain hold vast mines central to Gorsedd's wealth? Are they famed for a unique craft or resource found only within the mountain?
*   **Trade Routes:** What do they import vs what do they export? Where do their trade ships sail to? Are there rival port cities or trade agreements with other fantastical races?

**Culture & Daily Life:** 

*   **Religious Influence:** What deities/belief systems exist in Gorsedd? Are they tied to the sea, the mountain, the White Tree, or something else entirely?  Are there ornate temples or more humble worship practices?
*   **Tavern Tales:** Imagine the stories, songs, and legends passed down in Gorsedd's pubs and markets. Are they about brave sea captains? Secret mountain tunnels? The city's founding?
*   **Festivals:** Do they have celebratory events tied to the solstices, the tree, harvests, or historical victories? Think parades, costumes, unique foods! 

**Unique Details to Bring Gorsedd to Life:**

*   **Sea Bioluminescence:** Perhaps rare algae in the Gates of the Deep cause the water to glow at night, making docking a mesmerizing spectacle. 
*   **Mountain Aviary:** Ravens trained as message carriers could nest high on the tower, visually connecting it to the rest of the city. 
*   **Sacred Forge:** Dwarven master smiths might maintain a legendary forge deep within the mountain, its bellows causing the peak to faintly glow red on certain nights. 
*   **Hidden Knowledge:** The White Tree Courtyard could be a place for scholars and philosophers, the city harboring a repository of collected wisdom.

**Remember:** Don't provide answers to *all* of these questions in your worldbuilding. Leaving some open-ended invites mystery and room for stories to emerge! 

Absolutely! Here's a fresh batch of unique details to make Gorsedd stand out:

* **The Sound of the City:** The mountain's interior could be laced with natural resonating chambers. Winds whistling through them create an ever-present, haunting melody unique to Gorsedd, almost like the city itself is singing.
* **Echo-location Specialists:**  Citizens living in perpetually dim lower levels of the city might have adapted over generations. Some boast enhanced hearing and make masterful guides through the under-city, relying on echoes rather than sight. 
* **Shared Cuisine:**  Dwarven and human culinary traditions have merged over time. Imagine hearty stews served in hollowed-out stones, pastries dusted with shimmering cave crystals, or ale brewed with water from an underground spring.
* **Symbiotic Architecture:** The hanging gardens aren't just beautiful. Perhaps certain plants draw nutrients from the raw mountain stone or purify water for the city, creating a delicate environmental balance.
* **Illuminated Tribute:** On important holidays, thousands of small lanterns or bioluminescent mosses might be released from the tower peak, drifting down the mountainside like a waterfall of stars. This could be a tribute to fallen soldiers, a signal to allies, or a spiritual ritual.

Let me know if you'd like even more ideas, or want to brainstorm how these details could inspire plot points and characters! 

Here are some festival ideas for Gorsedd, drawing on the unique details and potential themes we've discussed:

Major Festivals:

* **Festival of the Deep:** This week-long celebration centers around Porth y Dyfnder, the sea gate. Think boat races, seafood feasts, blessings on ships for safe journeys, and vibrant displays of bioluminescent sea creatures.
* **Forge-Lighting:** An annual event where the Sacred Forge is reignited. It could be a time of dwarven craftsmanship displays, fiery spectacles, and perhaps the creation of a single object of great significance for the city.
* **Echo-Song:** This music-centric festival is less about melody and more about the haunting sounds of the city. Wind instruments, echoing chants, and percussive performances that resonate through the mountain's chambers would be key.
* **Tower Bloom:** Tied to the blossoming of the White Tree in its courtyard. It might be a time of reflection, wisdom-sharing, storytelling, and perhaps even offerings or wishes placed within the tree's branches.

Smaller, Quirky Festivals: 

* **Lantern Fall Commemoration:** Based on the idea of lanterns cascading down the mountain, this could evolve into a smaller, more somber festival. Residents release personalized lanterns in memory of loved ones or to symbolize letting go of past burdens.
* **Harvests of the Heights:** Perhaps certain high-altitude herbs or fruits are a delicacy in Gorsedd. This could be a smaller celebration with unique mountain-grown delicacies, competitions for climbing prowess, and even playful offerings left for the ravens of the Tower. 

Additional Notes:

* **Cross-Cultural Influences:**  Consider blending dwarven and human traditions for some festivals. 
* **Seasonality:** Some festivals might be tied to solstices, harvests, or even rough sea conditions that make docking treacherous in winter. 
* **Festival = Story Opportunities:** Think about what tensions might arise around these celebrations, what visitors they might attract, or if any age-old traditions become threatened.

Mining rare gems,

Here's a Welsh alternative to the Black Endoguard, drawing inspiration from Welsh mythology and folklore:

**Name:** Gwylwyr Coch ("Red Watchers")

**Appearance:** 

* Clad in crimson cloaks that billow in the wind, with dark leather armor underneath.
* Their faces are obscured by bronze helmets adorned with the fabled image of a red dragon (Y Ddraig Goch).
* They carry a variety of fearsome weapons, including long spears tipped with barbed points and ornately carved axes.

**Lore & Abilities:**

*  **Cwn Annwn** (Hounds of Annwn): The Gwylwyr Coch are rumored to be not entirely human. Legends say they hail from the Otherworld (Annwn), a realm of spirits and the dead. This grants them exceptional resilience and an unnerving ability to sense evil or treachery.

* **Druidic Magic:**  Imbued with the magic of ancient druids, the Gwylwyr Coch can call upon the power of nature to bolster their defenses or weaken their foes. Imagine sudden gusts of wind that unbalance attackers, or thick fog that disorients those with ill intent. 

* **Unyielding Fury:**  Driven by a fierce sense of justice and a cold, unwavering loyalty to Gorsedd, the Gwylwyr Coch are relentless in pursuit of their targets. They fight with a terrifying fury, fueled by a connection to the primal forces of the world. 

**Why Players Should Avoid Them:**

* **No Bribes, No Mercy:** Unlike their Black Endoguard counterparts, the Gwylwyr Coch are utterly incorruptible. They see themself as instruments of fate, and any attempt to sway them with coin or promises will likely be met with swift and brutal justice.
* **Hunters of the Unworthy:**  The Gwylwyr Coch possess an uncanny ability to sniff out those with darkness in their hearts. If the players have committed evil acts or harbor malicious intent within the city walls, they will be relentlessly pursued by the Red Watchers.
* **Unholy Strength:**  Their connection to the Otherworld grants them unnatural strength and endurance. Even a small group of Gwylwyr Coch can be a formidable challenge for unprepared players.

**Encounter Ideas:**

* The players witness the Gwylwyr Coch apprehending a notorious criminal in a brutal but efficient display of force. This encounter can highlight their ruthlessness and unwavering sense of justice.
* The party stumbles upon an ancient druidic ritual site that the Gwylwyr Coch are guarding. The players must navigate the situation carefully, avoiding any actions that might be misconstrued as a threat.
* The Red Watchers are called upon to investigate a series of mysterious happenings within the city. The players might find themselves working alongside (or perhaps against) the Gwylwyr Coch to solve the case.
