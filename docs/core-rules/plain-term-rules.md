## Life and Guard

You start with 8 Life and 8 Guard. You roll two six-sided dice and you want the result to be under your Life or Guard. if it's equal, you succeed but you lose something or something goes wrong. If you roll over, you don't get what you want.

Life is anything to do with your body. if you want to do something physical or something happens to your body, you make a Life Save. 

Guard is more abstract. It represents your ability to perceive threats, defend yourself and do things without people noticing.

In combat, you take damage to your Guard first, and then your Life when you have no Guard left. 


## Inventory & Consumables

You have 10 slots of inventory, including your hands, body, head and belt. Each piece of equipment takes up one slot, unless it is petty. Some items take up more slots.

Whenever you use equipment like lockpicks or a torch, you roll one six-sided die. If the result is gone, then you have run out of that item and you need to buy more.

Whenever you buy something, you roll 1d6 and if the result is 1 you downgrade your currency. The smallest amount of currency you can have is a handful of copper coins and the most is a chest of gold.

There are four stages of currency: handful (petty), pouch (1 slot), sack (2 slots) and chest (4 slots). A chest of copper coins can be traded for a handful of silver coins. 

Each piece of Armour reduces the maximum damage done to you by 1, up to a maximum of 3.

Armour is consumable. When a piece of armour is struck, roll 1d6 and if the result is 1, that piece of armour is gone.

## Combat


There are three distances in combat: melee, reach and ranged.

You can have a light, standard or heavy weapon. 

You can conceal a light weapon, but when you roll for damage you roll two six-sided dice and use the lowest result.

Standard weapons just roll one six-sided dice for damage.

Heavy weapons require both hands, and you have to put them down if you want to do anything else with your hands but when you roll for damage, you roll two six-sided dice and take the highest result.

If your weapon is **enchanted** you roll two six-sided dice and use the sum of both rolls for your damage. Enchantments are consumable, so roll 1d6 to see if your weapon is still enchanted.

You can apply **oil** to your weapon, designed for use against a specific monster. Oil works like enchantment and can be combined to do a total damage of three six-sided dice.

If two people attack the same person or creature in a round, only of their damage rolls counts - the highest result of either attack is used. Holding two weapons is the same, you can roll for damage twice but only use one result.

Melee weapons can attack only in melee. Ranged can only attack in ranged, and reach weapons can attack in both but not reach.

## Magic

You have **Magic Dice**, equal to your training in Magic. A Novice has 1 magic dice, an adept has two, an expert has three and a master has four.

Wearing Robes increases your Magic Dice by 1, and each piece of armour reduces your Magic Dice by 1.
