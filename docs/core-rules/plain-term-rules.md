You start with 8 Life and 8 Guard. You roll two six-sided dice and you want the result to be under your Life or Guard. if it's equal, you succeed but you lose something or something goes wrong. If you roll over, you don't get what you want.

Life is anything to do with your body. if you want to do something physical or something happens to your body, you make a Life Save. 

Guard is more abstract. It represents your ability to perceive threats, defend yourself and do things without people noticing.

In combat, you take damage to your Guard first, and then your Life when you have no Guard left.
