# Magic



## Sacrifice

Sacrifice an inventory slot to permanently learn a spell. 

Casting Spells

Casting spells requires a Grimoire, Scroll or Conduit . To cast with your Grimoire or Scroll, hold either in both hands and invest Magic Dice (MD). You start with 1 MD and can increase the number of MD you have through Training (see Training, page x.x). Wearing Robes increases your number of MD by 1. Roll the MD you invest. Any die with a result higher than your skill in Magic is lost until you next Rest. You may not invest more MD than available inventory slots.

If you roll a double, roll on the Mishaps table. On a triple, roll on the Doom table.
Grimoire

Grimoires are Bulky and can contain any number of spells.
Copying Spells

You can copy spells from scrolls into your grimoire.

This requires:

50◍ for gold inks.
One Halfwatch (4 hours).
The scroll, which will be destroyed in the process.
Creating a Grimoire

Creating a grimoire is time consuming and expensive.

You will need:

One scroll, which will be sacrificed in the process.
200◍ for inks.
A blank book.
One Watch (8 hours) of undisturbed labour under a full moon.
You will be Deprived after completing the ritual.
Scrolls

Scrolls contain a single spell, are petty and are destroyed after one use but otherwise act like your Grimoire.
Conduit

Conduits may be equipped as a 1H, 2H or R Weapon. Wands (R), sceptres (1H) and staves (2H) can be imbued with a single spell through enchantment (see Enchantment, page x.x)
Magic Dice

You have MD equal to the number of available, unoccupied inventory slots, You can invest up to four of them in a spell, referred to as "[dice]". Some spells also "[sum]" which is the sum of the dice rolled, or "[best]" which is the single highest result. One die invested is [di1], two dice invested is [di2] and so on.
Range

The Range of a spell (R) is typically 3 squares from the caster, but may also be determined by the number of dice invested [di] [di1] would be one square from the caster; [di2] would be two squares from the caster, and so on. If a spell targets a creature/object/point, the target must be visible to the caster with an unobstructed path.
Area

A spell can cover an Area. The Area can be determined by the number of dice invested. If the Spell's surface is a flat plane, its number of squares can be determined either by [dice] invested or the [best] result. If the surface area is a two-dimensional flat plane, such as 2 x 2 squares, the spell's description will list the area as [dice²] or [best²]. If the surface area covers a three-dimension cubic area, such as 3 x 3 x 3 squares, the spell's description will list the area as [dice³] or [best³].
Duration

A Spell's Duration (D) can be vary, but most commonly they are maintained for as long as [dice] are invested, this is called Concentration. Whilst [dice] are invested to maintain Concentration on a spell, you move as though you are Encumbered and are Exposed. You can concentrate on more than one spell at a time, but being attacked will break your concentration unless you pass a CLA save.

If the player rolls 4-6 and the die is lost, the spell cannot be concentrated and will instead end after ten seconds or one round of combat.
Save

If a Condition is applied to a Creature, they must pass a CLA saving throw or suffer its effects.
