# Basic Rules

## Dice

* ■: Roll d6.
* ■+: roll 2d6, take the highest result.
* ■-: roll 2d6, take the lowest result.

## Saves

A Save is a roll to avoid a bad outcome from risky choices and circumstances, generally whenever something bad happens to the you or you want to do something. To save, ■■ and compare the result to your Life or Guard, whichever the Cyfarwydd determines. 

When considering whether to roll a Save, the Cyfwarydd will note whether you have the Time or Gear to complete the task.

- If you have **neither**, the task is impossible.
- If you have **one**, then consider a roll.
- If you have **both**, no need to roll. You succeed.

The result must be under the your Life or Guard to succeed. A result equal to the your Life or Guard is a partial success with a **consequence**. 

On a failure, you face a consequence. 

If the consequence is not obvious, you lose something (like expend a slot of ammo), are offered a devil's bargain to get what you want, or you get **dynamite** - the Cyfarwydd lights a fuse and decides what is about to happen, or will set the dynamite off if it is already lit.

## Life

Life represents your ability to cope well under external (physical, mental, spiritual etc.) pressure.

You must also save whenever they attempt **direct** actions like fleeing, bending things, smashing doors down, swinging on a rope, scaling walls or falling from a great height.

Damage to Life occurs when you take damage that is not absorbed either by your **Guard** or **Armour**.

If you are at 1 Life, you are considered critically injured. You fail any Save and can only crawl along the floor.

When your Life is reduced to zero, another character must check on you and consult the Oracle. On a yes, you are alive with 1 Life. On no, you have died. If the answer is "not quite" then you are alive, but dying and you have mere moments to say goodbye.

When you die, create a new character or take control of a hireling. You immediately rejoin the party as soon as it is out of combat.

## Guard

Guard reflects your ability to avoid damage in combat. It is also a measure of your ability to detect threats, dodge incoming attacks or trap effects and scrutinise intentions. Save vs Guard whenever you attempt **discrete** actions such as hiding, lockpicking or pickpocketing and **resourceful** actions like recalling lore, appraising goods, using equipment, currency or contacts and first aid.

Outside of combat, you take damage directly to your Life.

You regain your Guard with a sip of water. A brewed, steaming cup of tea will increase your maximum Guard by 1 until it is lost.

## Rest

You heal at Lunch and Rest. Lunch requires a ration and restores d6 Life. Rest requires a ration, one Watch, warmth and shelter. Rest restores all Life and clear 1 Fatigue from your inventory.

## Armour

Armour provides a bonus to defence (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits according to their use.

Nobody may have more than 3 Armor. You may choose to sunder your shield in place of taking damage and wearing a helmet precents your from gaining the Dazed condition.

Additionally, a piece of armour protects you from the effects of the Dismemberment table the first three times. On the third strike, the armour is lost. 

Wearing armour in town suggests to the townsfolk that you intend to have a deadly fight, i.e. intend to commit murder. There should be consequences. Town guards are unarmoured unless actively under siege.

### Armour is worn when...

* You know that combat is likely and imminent. This may or may not include formal duels, depending on time and place.
* You are mustered as a formal military formation.
* Combat tournaments using weapons.
* Dedicated training periods in dedicated locations.

## Inventory

You have 10 inventory slots, including 2 **hands**, **body**, **head** and **belt** (4 slots). If you try to carry more, you become **encumbered** and can't do anything like fight, jump or run. You will have to make use of carts, wagons and horses.

* Heavy weapons cause ■+ damage, take both hands and can't be stowed. 
* Medium weapons cause ■ and take 2 slots. 
* Light weapons cause ■- damage, can be concealed and take up one slot. 
* Ranged weapons cause ■, take one slot can only be used at 10 metres or further. Thry deal -1 damage for every additional 10 metres distance.
* Most others items take up one slot. 
* Petty items do not take up any slots. 
* Items that come in bundles like ammunition are **consumable**.

## Consumables

■ when using consumable items like rations, tea, currency or lockpicks. On a roll of 1, the item is expended. If a PC has an item like lockpicks, it is assumed they know how to use them. There is a list of consumables in the Marketplace on page x.x.

## Currency

Modwry (◍) is the currency of Mynyddmôr. Modwry coins are shaped like intricate rings.

A handful of coins (◍ handful) is petty.

A pouch of coins (◍ pouch) takes 1 slot.

A sack of coins (◍ sack) takes 2 slots.

A chest of coins (◍ chest) takes 4 slots.

PCs can exchange coins at a bank. A chest of bronze Modwry (◍bz chest) is equal to a handful of silver Modwry (◍sv handful), and a chest of silver Modwry (◍sv chest) is equal to a handful of gold Modwry (◍gd handful). 

### Purchasing Items

■ whenever you use currency. On a roll of 1, your currency is downgraded. A Chest becomes a Sack, a Sack becomes a Pouch, and a Pouch becomes a Handful, until you have none left.

While a handful of silver Modwry can be exchanged for a chest of copper coins, rolling a 1 does not downgrade a handful of silver coins to a copper chest. The coins are simply spent.

## Vision

If it's **dim**, you can't search or identify details. If it's **dark**, you're encumbered as well, regardless of your inventory. If you have a light, it's light for 10 meters, and dim for that distance again.

## Conditions

Conditions take up inventory slots. Save vs Life to resist gaining a condition, or to break free from one.

|Condition|Description|Trigger|
|----|----|-----|
|Blinded      | | |
|Charmed      | | |
|Deafened     | | |
|Deprived     |You cannot recover Life or Guard, cannot cast spells and all Saves rolled are at Disadvantage. |You lack a crucial need (such as rations or rest) |
|Fatigue      | | |
|Frightened   | | |
|Grappled     | | |
|Incapacitated| | |
|Invisible    | | |
|Panicked     |Your Guard is reduced to 0, you do not act in the first round of combat and all damage is reduced by half. |You are surrounded by enemies, engulfed in darkness, or confronting your greatest fears. |
|Paralysed    | | |
|Petrified    | | |
|Poisoned     | | |
|Prone        | | |
|Restrained   | | |
|Stunned      | | |
|Unconscious  | | |

## Reaction

| 2d6    | NPC Reaction |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2      | As aggressively hostile as the situation allows|
| 3 - 5  | More unfriendly and hostile than they'd be expected to be in the given situation|
| 6 - 8  | As predictably hostile or friendly as they'd usually be in this situation|
| 9 - 11 | More friendly and benign than you'd expect them to be, given the circumstances|
| 12     | As friendly and helpful as their nature and the situation permits them to be |

The lead PC may make a Guard save to avoid a negative reaction. A failure will make things worse, however.

## Reputation

Reputation is awarded (+1) for a significant contribution to a location, profession or faction, or for being of the same station, and is effective only in that context.

## Morale

Enemies have a Morale Value and some have a Flee Condition. To test Morale, ■- if the value is lower than or equal to the Morale Value, the enemy does not flee.

Enemies with a Flee Condition, such as contact with Fire, will flee at the first sight of their trigger.

Morale should be tested when enemies take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.

1 Morale is lost every time an enemy tests their Morale.

You are not affected by Morale.

## Chases (Swyvers)

## Distance

In general, distances are measured in metres. However, when playing on a grid, distances are measured in Squares (sq), with 1sq representing 3 metres. Diagonal movement costs the same as horizontal movement. Climbing vertically costs twice as much movement.

## Clocks

To track complex things,sometimes a clock is used. A clock is a circle divided into segments called ticks. The more complex the problem, the more ticks. 2-ticks is simple; 4-ticks  is complex; 8-ticks is daunting.

## Timekeeping

Combat timeis in rounds. Around is enough time for a back and forth between foes.  

Dungeoneering time is in turns. A turn is enough time to do most things you’d do as you explore a dungeon.

Journeying time is in Watches. A Watch (8 hours) is enough time to travel a hex, and there are three every day.

Downtime is in weeks. Seven days of real time between gaming sessions earns a week of downtime actions.

## Language

On encountering a new language, you can attempt to understand it if you have language slots available. Roll on the Language table.

The check has disadvantage if the language is ancient or primordial, or advantage if it is related to a language you already know.

| 2d6    | Language |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2      | Gain "Erudite" proficiency. Speak, read, and write flawlessly, indistinguishable from a native speaker.|
| 3 - 5  | Gain "Fluent" proficiency. Speak and read with a slight accent.|
| 6 - 8  | Gain "Basic" proficiency. Speak basic ideas, understand written ones (ancient/dead languages).
| 9 - 11 | No understanding, no proficiency.|
| 12     | Gain "Poor" proficiency. Misunderstandings may cause offense. |

Common is a pidgin language, useful only for basic interaction (buying/selling).
It's spoken by everyone, doesn't occupy a language slot, and cannot be used for books.

### Secret Languages

Certain groups (druids, thieves, monsters) have unique languages.

Magical research might use devilish, angelic, primordial, or ancient variants.

These languages are typically unlearnable for outsiders except in unusual cases.

Any secret language you possess occupies a language slot.

### Language Table

|Language|Spoken by|
|----|----|
|Yr Hen Iaith (The Old Tongue)| |
|Cyfrwng y Bwganod (Goblin Tongue)| |
|Iaith y Ffrwd (River Tongue)| |
|Tafodiaeth y Coed (Forest Tongue)| |
|Iaith y Cwyr (Tongue of the Titans)| |
|Caniad y Tylwyth Teg (Song of the Fair Folk)| |
|Y Sibrwd (The Whisper)| |
