# Basic Rules

## Saves

A Save is a roll to avoid a bad outcome from risky choices and circumstances, generally whenever something happens to the PC. To save, PCs roll 2d6 and compare the result to their **Life** or **Guard**, whichever the Cyfarwydd determines. 

The result must be under the PC's Life or Guard to succeed. A result equal to the PC's Life or Guard is a partial success with a consequence. On a failure, PCs face a **consequence**. 

If the consequence is not obvious, you lose something (like expend a slot of ammo), are offered a devil's bargain to get what you want, or you get **dynamite**. The Cyfarwydd lights a fuse and decides what is about to happen, or will set the dynamite off if it is already lit. // Look into Monsterhearts for the origin of this rule.

## Life

Life represents a PCs ability to cope well under external (physical, mental, spiritual etc.) pressure. PCs make a Life Save whenenever they must resist Poison, Fear, Wands, Paralysis, Breath Weapons or Charm. PCs roll Life to break free from being grappled, flee or anything else that puts the PC in mortal danger.

Damage to Life occurs when a PC takes damage that is not absorbed either by their **Guard** or **Armour**.

A character at 1 Life is considered critically injured. They will fail any Save and can only crawl along the floor.

Life may only be regained with rest in a safe location within civilization, such as an inn or at a Sacred Site.

When any of the character's Life is reduced to zero, another character must check on them and consult the Oracle. On a yes, they are alive with 1 Life. On no, they have died. If the answer is "not quite" then the PC is alive, but dying and they have mere moments to say goodbye.

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

## Guard

Guard reflects a character's ability to avoid damage in combat. It is also a measure of your ability to detect threats, dodge and scrutinise intentions. Guard can be used as part of the Reaction roll and also determines whether a unit is Surprised at the start of combat.

Outside of combat, PCs take damage directly to their Life.

PCs regain 1d6 Guard with a sip of water, or may spend a Halfwatch (4 hours) resting to regain all of their Guard. A brewed, steaming cup of tea will increase total Guard by 1 until it is lost.

## Skill

Skills are grouped into three Approaches: **Direct**, **Discrete** and **Resourceful**.

Skills start at 1 (Novice) and can be increased to 5 (Expert). A skill roll is a d6, aiming for equal or under the skill level.

* Direct: Intimidation, bending things, smashing doors down, scaling walls.
* Discrete: Forgery, disguise, seduction, pickpocketing, lockpicking.
* Resourceful:  Historical knowledge, appraisal of goods, using equipment, currency or contacts, recalling lore, first aid.

When considering whether to roll a Skill Test, note whether the PC has the Time or Gear to complete the task.

- If the PCs have **neither**, the task is impossible.
- If the PCs have **one**, then consider a roll.
- If the PC has **both**, no need to roll. The PC succeeds.

Training a skill takes time, costs Modwry and requires an expert (see Training, page x.x).

## Armour

Armour provides a bonus to defence (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits according to their use.

A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor. PCs with an equipped shield may choose to Sunder their shield in place of taking damage, while wearing a helmet prevents the PC becoming Dazed.

Additionally, armour protects the wearer from the effects of the Dismemberment table the first three times. On the third strike, the armour is lost and the wearer is susceptible. 

To wear armor in town means you intend to have a deadly fight, i.e. intend to commit murder. There should be consequences. Town guards are unarmoured unless actively under siege.

Armour is worn when...

Warriors/soldiers know that combat is likely and imminent. This may or may not include formal duels, depending on time and place.

They are mustered as a formal military formation.
Combat tournaments using weapons.

Dedicated training periods in dedicated locations.

## Vision

You can see as if it were daylight,as twilight, or as darkness. • Sightasdaylightcansee just f ine, thank you. • Sightastwilightextends only a stone’s throw away. • Sightasdarknesscannotsee. All artificial light sources allow you to see as twilight. If travelling in darkness, when you retreat from the underground,or you are interrupted by an encounter, spend 1d4 HPper turn (while underground) or watch (while outdoors) you have travelled in darkness. There is no saving throw to avoid this cost.

## Inventory

Characters have inventory slots equal to their Life, but can only carry four items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots.

## Conditions

### Panic

#### Trigger

A character surrounded by enemies, engulfed in darkness, or confronting their greatest fears may experience panic. A CLA saving throw is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming panicked.

#### Overcoming Panic

As an action on their turn, a panicked character must make a Life saving throw to overcome the condition.
Effects

#### A panicked character suffers the following effects until their condition ends:

Reduced Health: Their GRD is considered 0 for all purposes.
Delayed Action: They do not act in the first round of combat.
Impaired Attacks: All their attacks are impaired.

## Deprivation

A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is considered Deprived. A Deprived PC cannot recover Life or Guard, cannot cast spells and all Saves rolled are at Disadvantage.

## Reaction

| 2d6    | NPC Reaction |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2      | As aggressively hostile as the situation allows|
| 3 - 5  | More unfriendly and hostile than they'd be expected to be in the given situation|
| 6 - 8  | As predictably hostile or friendly as they'd usually be in this situation|
| 9 - 11 | More friendly and benign than you'd expect them to be, given the circumstances|
| 12     | As friendly and helpful as their nature and the situation permits them to be |

The lead PC may make a Guard save to avoid a negative reaction. A failure will make things worse, however.

## Reputation

Reputation is awarded (+1) for a significant contribution to a location, profession or faction, or for being of the same station, and is effective only in that context.

## Morale

Enemies have a Morale Value and some have a Flee Condition. To test Morale, roll 2d6 - if the value is lower than or equal to the Morale Value, the enemy does not flee.

Enemies with a Flee Condition, such as contact with Fire, will flee at the first sight of their trigger.

Morale should be tested when enemies take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.

1 Morale is lost every time an enemy tests their Morale.

Morale does not affect PCs.

## Distance

In general, distances are measured in metres. However, when playing on a grid, distances are measured in Squares (sq), with 1sq representing 3 metres. Diagonal movement costs the same as horizontal movement. Climbing vertically costs twice as much movement.

## Clocks

To track complex things,sometimes a clock is used. A clock is a circle divided into segments called ticks. The more complex the problem, the more ticks. 2-ticks is simple; 4-ticks  is complex; 8-ticks is daunting.

## Timekeeping

Combat timeis in rounds. Around is enough time for a back and forth between foes.  

Dungeoneering time is in turns. A turn is enough time to do most things you’d do as you explore a dungeon.

Journeying time is in Watches. A Watch (8 hours) is enough time to travel a hex, and there are three every day.

Downtime is in weeks. Seven days of real time between gaming sessions earns a week of downtime actions.

## Language

On encountering a new language, you can attempt to understand it if you have language slots available. Roll on the Language table.

The check has disadvantage if the language is ancient or primordial, or advantage if it is related to a language you already know.

| 2d6    | Language |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2      | Gain "Erudite" proficiency. Speak, read, and write flawlessly, indistinguishable from a native speaker.|
| 3 - 5  | Gain "Fluent" proficiency. Speak and read with a slight accent.|
| 6 - 8  | Gain "Basic" proficiency. Speak basic ideas, understand written ones (ancient/dead languages).
| 9 - 11 | No understanding, no proficiency.|
| 12     | Gain "Poor" proficiency. Misunderstandings may cause offense. |

Common is a pidgin language, useful only for basic interaction (buying/selling).
It's spoken by everyone, doesn't occupy a language slot, and cannot be used for books.

### Secret Languages

Certain groups (druids, thieves, monsters) have unique languages.

Magical research might use devilish, angelic, primordial, or ancient variants.

These languages are typically unlearnable for outsiders except in unusual cases.

Any secret language you possess occupies a language slot.

### Language Table

|Language|Spoken by|
|----|----|
|Yr Hen Iaith (The Old Tongue)| |
|Cyfrwng y Bwganod (Goblin Tongue)| |
|Iaith y Ffrwd (River Tongue)| |
|Tafodiaeth y Coed (Forest Tongue)| |
|Iaith y Cwyr (Tongue of the Titans)| |
|Caniad y Tylwyth Teg (Song of the Fair Folk)| |
|Y Sibrwd (The Whisper)| |

## Currency

Modwry (◍) is the currency of Mynyddmôr. Modwry coins are shaped like intricate rings.

A handful of coins (◍ handful) is petty.

A pouch of coins (◍ pouch) takes 1 slot.

A sack of coins (◍ sack) takes 2 slots.

A chest of coins (◍ chest) takes 4 slots.

PCs can exchange coins at a bank. A chest of bronze Modwry (◍bz chest) is equal to a handful of silver Modwry (◍sv handful), and a chest of silver Modwry (◍sv chest) is equal to a handful of gold Modwry (◍gd handful). 

### Purchasing Items

Whenever you purchase an item, roll d6. On a roll of 1, your currency is downgraded. A Chest becomes a Sack, a Sack becomes a Pouch, and a Pouch becomes a Handful, until you have none left.

While a handful of silver Modwry can be exchanged for a chest of copper coins, rolling a 1 does not downgrade a handful of coins to a chest. The coins are spent.
