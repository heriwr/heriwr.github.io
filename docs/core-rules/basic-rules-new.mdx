Use an oracle of your choice.

If you don't have an oracle to hand, use this:

Roll two six-sided dice.

If both dice are even, the answer is a strong yes.

If both dice are odd, the answer is a strong no.

If the first die is even, and the second die is odd then the answer is a weak yes.

If the first die is odd, and the second die is even then the answer is a weak no.
