# Chapter I. First Steps

## How do you play?

One player is the **Bardd**. They set the scene and open the world to questions and exploration, asking **"what do you next?"**

The other players interact with the world and roll dice to determine the outcome of their actions.

The Cyfarwydd guides the players through an adventure while the players make meaningful choices.

The goal of the Player Characters (PCs) is to find treasure and to avoid a messy death.

## What do you need?

A pencil, paper, and a six-sided die (d6).

If you want the best out of the game, however, have at least seven six-sided die, with at least two different colours.

## Character Creation

You start with a handful of coins, a torch and three day's rations.
