# Transport in Vaarn
Note that ‘Hull Points’ represent a vehicle’s resilience to harm. Hull Points map to weapon damage at a ratio of 1 to 10. Damage incurred in amounts less than 10 can never reduce a vehicle’s Hull Points. Multiple sources of damage in a single combat round do not stack. A dune skuggy that takes 6, 7, and 8 points of damage from separate attacks will not lose any Hull Points, despite the combined total damage being 21. A dune skuggy that takes 19 points of damage from a single source will lose one Hull Point. This means that only the heaviest weapons and largest creatures can meaningfully damage vehicles. For pack-beasts with a Level, calculate HP as normal.

## Auto-Chariot
_Synthetic_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 8</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 18</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Medium</td><td><b>Value</b>: High</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Laser-targeted gauss cannon (d12)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Rugged wheeled conveyance with a synthetic mind. Auto-chariots are treasured possessions, as they are able to drive themselves without the intervention of the passengers, and will obey a set of simple instructions. Due to their sapience they are very difficult to steal, as they usually will not accept a new master until the old has died.</td></tr>

## Dune Skuggy
_Mechanical_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 5</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 13</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Fast</td><td><b>Value</b>: Low</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Flak-blaster turret (d10)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Simple, crude desert vehicles that run on guzzline. Dune-Skuggies are hacked together from whatever metal their maker could steal or scavenge, usually nothing but a seat protected by a roll-cage, bolted to a roaring smoky engine that drives four ravenous wheels. Skuggies are fast, rough, and loud, and their owners are usually the same.</td></tr>

## Iron Mule
_Synthetic_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 1</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 18</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Plodding</td><td><b>Value</b>: Low</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: None</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: A breed of synth that must once have been in mass production, for they are commonly found across Vaarn. Iron Mules are boxy, crude automata with four powerful, restless legs. They are known for their extreme endurance and hardiness, and also for their clumsiness, stupidity, and the nauseating rocking motion of their gait. Normally used as pack animals, but can be ridden in extremis.</td></tr>

## Motile Home
_Biological_ / _Synthetic_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 15</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 22</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Slow</td><td><b>Value</b>: </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Huge Claw (2d10)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: The fad for living architecture peaked several millennia ago, but there are still some examples of self-aware, motile dwellings to be found in the hinterlands of Vaarn. These rare constructions are half crab, half house, and fully sentient. They are not known for spacious interiors or fast movement, but make up for this with their extreme durability.</td></tr>

## Ornithopter
_Mechanical_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 7</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 18</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Rapid</td><td><b>Value</b>: </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Laser Lance (3d6)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Pre-Collapse flying machines that beat artificial wings to stay aloft. Smaller ornithopters are hummingbird-like, and seat two passengers, while larger combat ornithopters resemble dragonflies, and carry Hegemony soldiers wherever they are required.</td></tr>

## Skiff
_Mechanical_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 2</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 16</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: High</td><td><b>Value</b>: Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Light pulse-rifle (d8)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: A Lightweight hover-bike build around a small sky-seeking stone. Skiffs are powered by a fan at the back of the craft. They are fast and nimble, but unstable and frequently lethal when they malfunction. Used by outlaws, Hegemony rangers, bounty hunters, and anyone else who needs to make a quick getaway.</td></tr>

## Stilt Strutter
_Mechanical_

<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 4</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 18</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Slow</td><td><b>Value</b>: </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Mounted Cannon (d12)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Ponderous towering mechanised walker. Prized for their hardy construction and ability to navigate treacherous ground. Utilised by Hegemony troops for assaults on fortified positions.</td></tr>

## War Camel
_Biological_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Level</b>: 4</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 15</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Moderate</td><td><b>Value</b>: Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Hump-mounted flechette cannon (d10) + Kick (d6)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Camels are still considered an excellent choice of desert mount, even in this late red era of Urth. War camels, fitted with mirror-armor and implanted flechette cannons, are used by Faa nomad raiders and Hegemony troops alike, and camel trains are one of the cheapest ventures a Vaarnish merchant can finance.</td></tr>

## Weeping Lizard
_Biological_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Level</b>: 3</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 16</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Fast once blood is warm</td><td><b>Value</b>: Low</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Bite (d8) + Toxic tears (CON save vs temporary blindness)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: For journeys in the northern mountains of Vaarn, where flickering lattices of hard light make flight untenable, and frequent earthquakes demolish roads and bridges, the Weeping Lizard is favoured as a steed. Named for the toxin it extrudes from its tear ducts when enraged, these truculent black pseudo-geckos can carry their passengers up surfaces as sheer as glass, and can leap across nauseating gaps with their powerful back legs.</td></tr>

## Wind-Barge
_Mechanical_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 20</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 22</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Dependant on winds</td><td><b>Value</b>: Very High</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Traditionally unarmed, but crew will include d6 Level 2 guards</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: A wooden cargo ship, built around a large sky-seeking stone. These barges are used by the merchant guilds of Vaarn to transport goods across the blue sands. Some are elegant and ornate vessels, while others are heavy and utilitarian. They are usually unarmed by ancient custom, although it would be a foolish merchant who ventured into the wastelands without guards onboard.</td></tr>

## Zeppelin
_Mechanical_
<table>
<tr><td><b>Hull Points</b>: 10</td><td><b>Armour</b>: 14</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Speed</b>: Relaxed</td><td><b>Value</b>: </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Armaments</b>: Bombs (d10 blast)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Elegant, refined flying machines. Relics of a more genteel age. Most Vaarnish zeppelins hail from the Great Wall, dispatched on trading sojourns or diplomatic missions by one of the Queens.</td></tr>
